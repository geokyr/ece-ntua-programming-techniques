Lab Assignments for the [Programming Techniques](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/3138) course, during the 2nd semester of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

## Lab Assignments

There were 4 lab assignments in total, each one consisting of a set of exercises that had to be submitted to the course's grader. The grader was a web application that automatically tested the submitted code against a set of test cases and provided feedback on the correctness of the solution, with time and memory constraints.

The aim was to get familiar with object oriented programming programming and with the most important data structures, both in C++. The key goals of the lab assignments in total are listed below.

## Object Oriented Programming

- Abstract Data Types
- Generalization and Specialization
- Locality
- Information Hiding
- Encapsulation
- Objects and Classes
- Access and Modification of Object Members
- Constructors and Destructors
- Inheritance
- Access Rules
- Protected Members
- Friend Functions
- Polymorphism
- Virtual Functions
- Operator, Function and Method Overloading

## Data Structures

- Linked Lists
- Doubly Linked Lists
- Circular Lists
- Ordered Lists
- Trees
- Binary Tree Traversal
- Depth-First Traversal
- Breadth-First Traversal
- Binary Search Trees
- AVL Trees
- Heaps
- Full Binary Trees
- Binary Heaps
- M-way Search Trees
- B-trees
- Hashing Methods and Functions
- Hash Tables
